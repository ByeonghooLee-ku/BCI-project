<Time domain parameter and correlation coefficients based Motor imagery related channel seletion method>

* Programming Language: MATLAB
* Contact: Y.K. Park (shoutme1@korea.ac.kr)
* Function: This algorithm is a channel selection method for motor imagery (MI) task classification based on the time domain parameter (TDP) and correlation coefficients of EEG channelpairs.
We select a most MI-related channel using Fisher ratio of TDPs.
Using the most MI-related channel, we finally select the MI-related channels which have high correlation with MI-related channel.
